## Introduction

<p align="justify"> In this assignment, a point cloud based model was created and trained to guess objects displayed in different scenes, using the [Washington RGB-D Dataset](https://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/). This program needs to pre-process the scene to retrieve each object and its properties to feed the model, narrating the object prediction and its characteristics through a text-to-speech library. Furthermore, this model was also applied to a real-time system using a RGB-D camera.</p>
